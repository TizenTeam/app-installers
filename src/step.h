  an integer value stating the execution issue. If the returned
  code is 0 then the excution finished succefuly. Otherwise,
  the returned code should be set to -1 with errno set to some
  meaningful value.

  The functions are:
    - process  process the installation step
    - undo     undo the installation step after failure
    - clean    remove temporary data of the step after success

 "clean" of the steps are called in the reverse order and a value of
 0 is returned.

 On error, the callback functions "undo" are called in the reverse
 order and the original error is returned.
